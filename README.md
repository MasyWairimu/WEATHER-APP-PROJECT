# WEATHER-APP-PROJECT

The weather app project is a project that I have developed using html, css and javascript where I have added the Open Weather API.

The system works by entering a city name and it gives feedback by displaying the area's temperature, wind speed and humidity as well as the name of the city.
In the instance of entering a city that does not exist, it responds by giving an error message.
